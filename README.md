The python file requires an input file named 'players.txt' to function. I've attached one already as a sample/template.

Drafting teams is as easy as clicking on 10 unique player buttons and then clicking 'Draft Teams'.

You can redraft the teams by simply clicking 'Draft Teams' again, which will generate a new assortment of balanced teams. This drafter does take roles into account and tries to keep as many players on-role as possible.

On closing the program the 'players.txt' file will be auto-sorted alphabetically.
